# Java-programs

☕ Java Fundamentals & DSA Playground
Welcome to my Java sandbox—a curated collection of programs that helped me build a strong foundation in Java and dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repo is part of my academic journey and job preparation.
📁 Folder Structure
- Basics of Java
Simple yet essential programs like:
- helloWorld.java – the classic first step
- fibonacci.java, primeCheck.java, geoProg.java – math-based logic building
- equilibriumIndex.java, sqrtbinary.java – intro to algorithmic thinking
- DSA
Hands-on implementations of:
- Sorting: bubbleSort.java, mergeSort.java, selectionSort.java, insertionSort.java
- Searching: binarySearch.java, linearSearch.java, lowerBound.java, upperBound.java
- Data Structures: linkedList.java, doubleLinkedList.java, QueueArray.java, graphImplementation.java
- Logic & Validation: mergeSortedArrays.java, paranthesisCheck.java
🎯 Why This Repo Exists
I built this collection to:
- Strengthen my Java fundamentals through example-driven learning
- Practice clean, modular code that’s easy to reuse and extend
🛠️ How I Work
Each program is:
- Written with clarity and formal structure
- Tested for correctness and edge cases
- Designed to be readable and adaptable for future enhancements
